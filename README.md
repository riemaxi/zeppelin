Zeppelin Bioinformatics

This project has the purpose of creating pipeline based tools for bioinformatics

Devided in two sub-projects

- Pipeplus. Engine that interpret a pipeline oriented script
- OpenSky. Collaborative and 'Distributed Computing Platform, mainly to execute Pipeplus scripts

The kind of projects that are planned to be implemented on top of Pipeplus:

- Combinatorial Optimisation
- Machine Learning
- Simulation
- Biological data analysis
- Automated gene annotation

This project can be applied to any field in computer science, but the decision is to narrow it down to bioinformatic applications, just to avoid distraction.
